Table Notes,,,,,,
"(a) In 2020 there were 234 students whose biological sex was reported as neither male nor female. In order to protect the confidentiality of these students the ABS has randomly assigned them to have either a male or female status. This approach aligns with the United Nations Statistical Division 2010, Handbook on Population and Housing Census Editing, Revision 1, (Sections 346-347).",,,,,,
(b) In 2016 the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) remoteness Indicator replaced the previously used Standing Council on School Education and Early Childhood (SCSEEC) remoteness indicator. The ASGS  is a measure of geographical remoteness: Metropolitan refers to mainland state capital city and city-based areas; Provincial refers to central and regional areas; Remote and Very Remote refer to isolated and highly remote areas.,,,,,,
(c) ACT has no Remote or Very Remote areas. Victoria has no Very Remote areas. NT has no Metropolitan areas.,,,,,,
"(d) Student FTE totals, by state and territory, may be different to figures published in other sources.",,,,,,
